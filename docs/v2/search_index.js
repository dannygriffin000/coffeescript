In that case, we want to convert modern JavaScript into older JavaScript that will run in older versions of Node or older browsers; for example, `{ a } = obj` into `a = obj.a`. This is done via transpilers like Babel, Bublé or Traceur Compiler.   Quickstart  From the root of your project:     Transpiling with the CoffeeScript compiler  To make things easy, CoffeeScript has built-in support for the popular Babel transpiler. You can use it via the `--transpile` command-line option or the `transpile` Node API option. To use either, `babel-core` must be installed in your project:    Or if you’re running the `coffee` command outside of a project folder, using a globally-installed `coffeescript` module, `babel-core` needs to be installed globally:    By default, Babel doesn’t do anything—it doesn’t make assumptions about what you want to transpile to. You need to provide it with a configuration so that it knows what to do. One way to do this is by creating a `.babelrc` file in the folder containing the files you’re compiling, or in any parent folder up the path above those files. (Babel supports other ways, too.) A minimal `.babelrc` file would be just `{ \"presets\": [\"env\"] }`. This implies that you have installed `babel-preset-env`:    See Babel’s website to learn about presets and plugins and the multitude of options you have. Another preset you might need is `transform-react-jsx` if you’re using JSX with React (JSX can also be used with other frameworks).  Once you have `babel-core` and `babel-preset-env` (or other presets or plugins) installed, and a `.babelrc` file (or other equivalent) in place, you can use `coffee --transpile` to pipe CoffeeScript’s output through Babel using the options you’ve saved.  If you’re using CoffeeScript via the Node API, where you call `CoffeeScript.compile` with a string to be compiled and an `options` object, the `transpile` key of the `options` object should be the Babel options:    You can also transpile CoffeeScript’s output without using the `transpile` option, for example as part of a build chain. This lets you use transpilers other than Babel, and it gives you greater control over the process. There are many great task runners for setting up JavaScript build chains, such as Gulp, Webpack, Grunt and Broccoli.   Polyfills  Note that transpiling doesn’t automatically supply polyfills for your code. CoffeeScript itself will output `Array.indexOf` if you use the `in` operator, or destructuring or spread/rest syntax; and `Function.bind` if you use a bound (`=>`) method in a class. Both are supported in Internet Explorer 9+ and all more recent browsers, but you will need to supply polyfills if you need to support Internet Explorer 8 or below and are using features that would cause these methods to be output. You’ll also need to supply polyfills if your own code uses these methods or another method added in recent versions of JavaScript. One polyfill option is `babel-polyfill`, though there are many other strategies.

Notice how all of the variable declarations have been pushed up to the top of the closest scope, the first time they appear. `outer` is not redeclared within the inner function, because it’s already in scope; `inner` within the function, on the other hand, should not be able to change the value of the external variable of the same name, and therefore has a declaration of its own.  Because you don’t have direct access to the `var` keyword, it’s impossible to shadow an outer variable on purpose, you may only refer to it. So be careful that you’re not reusing the name of an external variable accidentally, if you’re writing a deeply nested function.  Although suppressed within this documentation for clarity, all CoffeeScript output (except in files with `import` or `export` statements) is wrapped in an anonymous function: `(function(){ … })();`. This safety wrapper, combined with the automatic generation of the `var` keyword, make it exceedingly difficult to pollute the global namespace by accident. (The safety wrapper can be disabled with the `bare` option, and is unnecessary and automatically disabled when using modules.)  If you’d like to create top-level variables for other scripts to use, attach them as properties on `window`; attach them as properties on the `exports` object in CommonJS; or use an `export` statement. If you’re targeting both CommonJS and the browser, the existential operator (covered below), gives you a reliable way to figure out where to add them: `exports ? this`.  Since CoffeeScript takes care of all variable declaration, it is not possible to declare variables with ES2015’s `let` or `const`.

Comprehensions replace (and compile into) `for` loops, with optional guard clauses and the value of the current array index. Unlike for loops, array comprehensions are expressions, and can be returned and assigned.    Comprehensions should be able to handle most places where you otherwise would use a loop, `each`/`forEach`, `map`, or `select`/`filter`, for example:  `shortNames = (name for name in list when name.length   If you know the start and end of your loop, or would like to step through in fixed-size increments, you can use a range to specify the start and end of your comprehension.    Note how because we are assigning the value of the comprehensions to a variable in the example above, CoffeeScript is collecting the result of each iteration into an array. Sometimes functions end with loops that are intended to run only for their side-effects. Be careful that you’re not accidentally returning the results of the comprehension in these cases, by adding a meaningful return value — like `true` — or `null`, to the bottom of your function.  To step through a range comprehension in fixed-size chunks, use `by`, for example: `evens = (x for x in [0..10] by 2)`  If you don’t need the current iteration value you may omit it: `browser.closeCurrentTab() for [0...count]`  Comprehensions can also be used to iterate over the keys and values in an object. Use `of` to signal comprehension over the properties of an object instead of the values in an array.    If you would like to iterate over just the keys that are defined on the object itself, by adding a `hasOwnProperty` check to avoid properties that may be inherited from the prototype, use `for own key, value of object`.  To iterate a generator function, use `from`. See Generator Functions.  The only low-level loop that CoffeeScript provides is the `while` loop. The main difference from JavaScript is that the `while` loop can be used as an expression, returning an array containing the result of each iteration through the loop.    For readability, the `until` keyword is equivalent to `while not`, and the `loop` keyword is equivalent to `while true`.  When using a JavaScript loop to generate functions, it’s common to insert a closure wrapper in order to ensure that loop variables are closed over, and all the generated functions don’t just share the final values. CoffeeScript provides the `do` keyword, which immediately invokes a passed function, forwarding any arguments.

An omitted first index defaults to zero and an omitted second index defaults to the size of the array.    The same syntax can be used with assignment to replace a segment of an array with new values, splicing it.    Note that JavaScript strings are immutable, and can’t be spliced.

Even though functions will always return their final value, it’s both possible and encouraged to return early from a function body writing out the explicit return (`return value`), when you know that you’re done.  Because variable declarations occur at the top of scope, assignment can be used within expressions, even for variables that haven’t been seen before:    Things that would otherwise be statements in JavaScript, when used as part of an expression in CoffeeScript, are converted into expressions by wrapping them in a closure. This lets you do useful things, like assign the result of a comprehension to a variable:    As well as silly things, like passing a `try`/`catch` statement directly into a function call:    There are a handful of statements in JavaScript that can’t be meaningfully converted into expressions, namely `break`, `continue`, and `return`.

Instead of a newline or semicolon, `then` can be used to separate conditions from expressions, in `while`, `if`/`else`, and `switch`/`when` statements.

CoffeeScript’s existential operator `?` returns true unless a variable is `null` or `undefined` or undeclared, which makes it analogous to Ruby’s `nil?`.  It can also be used for safer conditional assignment than the JavaScript pattern `a = a || value` provides, for cases where you may be handling numbers or strings.    Note that if the compiler knows that `a` is in scope and therefore declared, `a?` compiles to `a != null`, not `a !== null`. The `!=` makes a loose comparison to `null`, which does double duty also comparing against `undefined`. The reverse also holds for `not a?` or `unless a?`.    If a variable might be undeclared, the compiler does a thorough check. This is what JavaScript coders should be typing when they want to check if a mystery variable exists.    The accessor variant of the existential operator `?.` can be used to soak up null references in a chain of properties. Use it instead of the dot accessor `.` in cases where the base value may be `null` or `undefined`.

In the simplest case, it can be used for parallel assignment:    But it’s also helpful for dealing with functions that return multiple values.    Destructuring assignment can be used with any depth of array and object nesting, to help pull out deeply nested properties.    Destructuring assignment can even be combined with splats.    Expansion can be used to retrieve elements from the end of an array without having to assign the rest of its values. It works in function parameter lists as well.    Destructuring assignment is also useful when combined with class constructors to assign properties to your instance from an options object passed to the constructor.    The above example also demonstrates that if properties are missing in the destructured object or array, you can, just like in JavaScript, provide defaults.

Just for kicks, a little bit of the compiler is currently implemented in this fashion: See it as a document, raw, and properly highlighted in a text editor.  A few caveats:  Code blocks need to maintain consistent indentation relative to each other. When the compiler parses your Literate CoffeeScript file, it first discards all the non-code block lines and then parses the remainder as a regular CoffeeScript file. Therefore the code blocks need to be written as if the comment lines don’t exist, with consistent indentation (including whether they are indented with tabs or spaces). Along those lines, code blocks within list items or blockquotes are not treated as executable code. Since list items and blockquotes imply their own indentation, it would be ambiguous how to treat indentation between successive code blocks when some are within these other blocks and some are not.

This was to spare developers the mental housekeeping of needing to worry about variable declaration (`var foo`) as opposed to variable assignment (`foo = 1`). The CoffeeScript compiler automatically takes care of declaration for you, by generating `var` statements at the top of every function scope. This makes it impossible to accidentally declare a global variable.  `let` and `const` add a useful ability to JavaScript in that you can use them to declare variables within a block scope, for example within an `if` statement body or a `for` loop body, whereas `var` always declares variables in the scope of an entire function. When CoffeeScript 2 was designed, there was much discussion of whether this functionality was useful enough to outweigh the simplicity offered by never needing to consider variable declaration in CoffeeScript. In the end, it was decided that the simplicity was more valued. In CoffeeScript there remains only one type of variable.

Supporting only one variant helps avoid confusing bugs that can arise from the subtle differences between the two forms.  Technically, `foo = function() {}` is creating an anonymous function that gets assigned to a variable named `foo`. Some very early versions of CoffeeScript named this function, e.g. `foo = function foo() {}`, but this was dropped because of compatibility issues with Internet Explorer. For a while this annoyed people, as these functions would be unnamed in stack traces; but modern JavaScript runtimes infer the names of such anonymous functions from the names of the variables to which they’re assigned.

We made this change because the previous behavior was inconsistent and basically a bug: depending on what grammar was where, for example if there was an inline function or something that implied a block, the `else` might bind to an earlier `then` rather than a later `then`. Now an `else` essentially closes a block opened by a `then`, similar to closing an open parenthesis. When a required `then` is missing, the error more accurately points out the location of the mistake. An error is thrown when the `coffee` command is run in an environment that doesn’t support some ES2015 JavaScript features that the CoffeeScript compiler itself requires. This can happen if CoffeeScript is installed in Node older than version 6. Destructuring with a non-final splat/spread, e.g. `[open, contents..., close] = tag.split('')` is now output using ES2015 rest syntax. Functions named `get` or `set` can be used without parentheses in more cases, including when attached to `this` or `@` or `?.`; or when the first argument is an implicit object, e.g. `@set key: 'val'`. Statements such as `break` can now be used inside parentheses, e.g. `(doSomething(); break) while condition` or `(pick(key); break) for key of obj`. Bugfix for assigning to a property attached to `this`/`@` in destructuring, e.g. `({@prop = yes, @otherProp = no}) ->`. Bugfix for incorrect errors being thrown about calling `super` with a parameter attached to `this` when said parameter is in a lower scope, e.g. `class Child extends Parent then constructor: -> super(-> @prop)`. Bugfix to prevent a possible infinite loop when a `for` loop is given a variable to step by, e.g. `for x in [1..3] by step` (as opposed to `by 0.5` or some other primitive numeric value). Bugfix to no longer declare iterator variables twice when evaluating a range, e.g. `end = 3; fn [0..end]`. Bugfix for incorrect scope of variables in chained calls, e.g. `start(x = 3).then(-> x = 4)`. Bugfix for incorrect scope of variables in a function passed to `do`, e.g. `for [1..3] then masked = 10; do -> alert masked`. Bugfix to no longer throw a syntax error for a trailing comma in a function call, e.g. `fn arg1, arg2,`. Bugfix for an expression in a property access, e.g. `a[!b in c..]`.

A tweak to the semantics of `do`, which can now be used to more easily simulate a namespace: `do (x = 1, y = 2) -> …` Loop indices are now mutable within a loop iteration, and immutable between them.
